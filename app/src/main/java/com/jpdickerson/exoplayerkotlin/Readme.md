ExoPlayer Kotlin is a music player project to showcase the ExoPlayer library in Kotlin.
As an addition, despite being deprecated the music player has the ability to either stream from 
the server or from a file via checking if internet is present. Kotlin synthetics were used for 
view-binding which been deprecated as well. A newer version of this project is in the pipeline to
dis-utilize deprecated coding practices. Stay tuned!
